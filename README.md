## What is Prime Number ?

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.In other words, a prime number can only be divided evenly(without a remainder) by 1 and the number itself.

### Examples of Prime Numbers

- 2(divisors: 1, 2)
- 3(divisors: 1, 3)
- 5(divisors: 1, 5)
- 7(divisors: 1, 7)
- 11(divisors: 1, 11)

### Non - Prime(Composite) Numbers

Numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are **not** prime because they have divisors other than 1 and themselves.

### Note

- 1 is **not** considered a prime number.
- 2 is the only even prime number.
